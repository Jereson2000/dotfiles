# Hyprland configuration
Here I keep version control of my hyprland configuration of my work PC in case I have to switch computers
or anything like that.

# Desktop addons
Things like kitty, waybar and wofi which are basically desktop components on hyprland I have decided to 
also keep in the hyprland repo since they are almost like children to the compositor.
To get this to work all the directories need to be symlinked to the .config directory.
